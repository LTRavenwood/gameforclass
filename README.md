I am making a smaller battle script as a project for class

## Development Notes:

The end goal for this script is to make 
a battle scene with a character and an enemy
The main battle should include an attack
method and a block method.

The block method should not stop the attack method
it should subtract the blocker's defense from the 
attackers damage when damage is dealt.

only one character out of the player and the enemy
can remain to finish the script and a 'You win' or
'You Lose' message would be needed.
